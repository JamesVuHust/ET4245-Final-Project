# ET4245-Final-Project
This is the source code of the project Violence Detection using Deep Learning by Group 1 - Class code 129286 - ET4245 AI and Application Course

We used Google Colab to train, test, evaluate and make inferences of the model using VGG16 and LSTM. All the related source code is grouped in a single notebook called VGG16_LSTM_Hockey_Final.ipynb. 

By default, this notebook will work on Hockey Fights dataset, but it can be easily swiched to work with the two other datasets including Movies Fights and Violent Flow. Please read the notebook for more details. 

The splitted dataset can be downloaded at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DxzRZ441wlaC5R0VtQZiNJVdaLBe3liO/view?usp=sharing
If you do not want to train the model, you can use the transfer values and trained model at this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CWqU3jWJavQAco_Nrc1sCAS7OnwRB9lm?usp=sharing

Please note that this notebook is designed to be run on Google Colab and some of the code connects the Colab to the Google Drive. You can use Google Drive or find another way of your comfort.

The notebook is based on the one by Pedro.F Rodenas. However, I have modified some of his code and added new code to meet my needs. You can take a look at Pedro's notebook and his github page at https://github.com/pedrofrodenas/Violence-Detection-CNN-LSTM
